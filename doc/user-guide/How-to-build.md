# How to build MongooseIM

## Requirements

To compile MongooseIM you need:

*   GNU Make
*   GCC
*   Libexpat 1.95 or higher
    * CentOS: expat-devel
    * Ubuntu: libexpat-dev
*   Erlang/OTP 18.3 or higher
*   Reltool 0.6.6 or higher
*   OpenSSL 0.9.8 or higher, for STARTTLS, SASL and SSL encryption
    * CentOS: openssl-devel
    * Ubuntu: libssl-dev
*   Zlib 1.2.3 or higher for Stream Compression support (XEP-0138). Optional.

## Compiling on macOS

MongooseIM is supported on Mac OS X / macOS 10.6.8 and later.
Before you can compile and run MongooseIM, you will need to install the following packages:

* C and C++ compiler
* Git
* Erlang/OTP 18.3 or higher
* OpenSSL

We recommend using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh) to manage packages on your Mac.
With Homebrew installed, getting all dependencies is a matter of running the following commands:

```bash
$ xcode-select --install # install compilation tools
$ brew install git erlang openssl
```

Additionally you'll need to export some environment variables to point the compiler to OpenSSL
installed with Homebrew:

```bash
$ export LDFLAGS="-L/usr/local/opt/openssl/lib -undefined dynamic_lookup $LDFLAGS"
$ export CXXFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include $CXXFLAGS"
$ export CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/opt/openssl/include $CFLAGS"
```

After you've done this, follow the steps from the [Compiling on *nix systems](#compiling-on-42nix-systems) section.

## Compiling on \*nix systems

To compile MongooseIM, go to the main repo directory `$REPO` and execute the command (`$` stands for the shell prompt):


        $ ./rebar3 compile

To generate full MongooseIM release (with mysql, pgsql or other deps):

        $ make rel

If more advanced release is required (with some specific db support only, f.e. mysql or pgsql) or you want to set `prefix` or `user` for the installation script please refer to the [release configuration](release_config.md) page in our documentation.

The `make rel` commands will generate a self-contained OTP system image in the project's `_build/prod/rel/mongooseim` subdirectory.
The contents of that directory are as follows:

*   `bin` - startup/administration scripts,
*   `etc` - configuration files,
*   `lib` - MongooseIM binary, header and runtime files,
*   `var` - spool directory,
*   `log` - log file directory,
*   `releases` - release files directory.

## Running MongooseIM

To run MongooseIM from the project tree after compiling it, change to `$REPO/_build/prod/rel/mongooseim`.

There you can use the `mongooseim` command line administration script to start and stop MongooseIM. For example, this command will start the server:

    $ bin/mongooseim start

You can also run the server in interactive mode:

    $ bin/mongooseim live

There's also a tool called `mongooseimctl` allowing you to perform some operations on a running instance, e.g.:

    $ bin/mongooseimctl status
    MongooseIM node mongooseim@localhost:
      operating system pid: 86026
      Erlang VM status: started (of: starting | started | stopping)
      boot script status: started
      version: 1.6.2-61-g48b8332
      uptime: 1:12:46
      logs:
        log/ejabberd.log

## Building the testing target and running tests

For testing purposes there's a different make target available:

    $ make devrel

which will generate releases `mim1`, `mim2`, `mim3`, `fed1` in `$REPO/_build/` and prepare them for testing and generating coverage reports.

To run the tests (from project's root directory, i.e. `$REPO`):

    $ tools/travis-test
