## New field in Message Archive Management MUC entries: Sender ID

As a part of ensuring GDPR compliance, it turned out it's essential to be able to efficiently query MAM MUC data via sender ID (to retrieve user's personal data).
Originally, the sender JID could be found only as a part of encoded XML message element, so finding all items sent by a certain user would be **extremely** inefficient (or rather: anti-efficient).
MongooseIM 3.3.0++ uses modified schema for MAM MUC backends which enables way more efficient extraction.

You may find migration instructions specific to your MAM backend below.

### RDBMS

#### Step 1

Please execute following SQL statements on your MIM database:

**MySQL**

```
ALTER TABLE mam_muc_message ADD COLUMN sender_id INT UNSIGNED;
CREATE INDEX i_mam_muc_message_sender_id USING BTREE ON mam_muc_message(sender_id);
```

**PostgreSQL**

```
ALTER TABLE mam_muc_message ADD COLUMN sender_id INT;
CREATE INDEX i_mam_muc_message_sender_id ON mam_muc_message USING BTREE (sender_id);
```

**MSSQL**

```
ALTER TABLE [dbo].[mam_muc_message] ADD sender_id bigint;
CREATE INDEX i_mam_muc_message_sender_id ON mam_muc_message(sender_id);
```

#### Step 2

Now you have a schema that is compatible with MIM 3.3.0++ but isn't GDPR-compliant yet because the new column has no meaningful data.

Please pick your favourite scripting/programming language and populate the new column with [dedicated script's help](jid-from-mam-muc-script.md) help.
You'll need to iterate over whole `mam_muc_message` table with the following algorithm:

1. Provide `message` column content to the script.
2. The script returns **sender's JID** as `username@server` string. You need to split it to get separate username and server parts.
3. Select ID from `mam_server_user` by the username and server. If it doesn't exist, insert a new one (`id` column is automatically incremented).
4. Update the `sender_id` column in `mam_muc_message` with the retrieved ID.
