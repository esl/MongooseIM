## Configuration options

There are some possible adjustments to the configuration file that you might need to make before upgrading.

### TLS `certfile` and `keyfile`

There are following places in the TOML configuration file where you can set up TLS certificates:

- [Outgoing connection pools](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md#tls-options)
- [S2S outgoing connections](../configuration/s2s.md#tls-options-for-outgoing-connections)
- [C2S listener](../listeners/listen-c2s.md#tls-options-for-c2s)
- [S2S listener](../listeners/listen-s2s.md#configuration-options)
- [Component listener](../listeners/listen-components.md#tls-options-for-components)
- [HTTP listener](../listeners/listen-http.md#tls-https-options)
- [Global distribution module](../modules/mod_global_distrib.md#tls-options)

In all such places, you specify the certificate file with the `certfile` option,
and the private key file with the `keyfile` option.
However, previous versions of MongooseIM also allowed putting the certificate concatenated with the private key
into one file referenced with the `certfile` option.
This is **no longer accepted** due to an update in Erlang/OTP 28.1,
and you need to make sure to use separate `certfile` and `keyfile` before upgrading MongooseIM.
