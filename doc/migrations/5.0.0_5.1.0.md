## Configuration changes

The configuration format has slightly changed and you might need to amend `mongooseim.toml`.

### Section `acl`

The implicit check for user's domain in patterns is now configurable and the default behaviour (previously undocumented) is more consistent - the check is always performed unless disabled with `match = "all"`.
See the description of [`current_domain`](../configuration/acl.md#aclmatch) for more details.

### Section `auth`

* Each authentication method needs a TOML section, e.g. if you have the `rdbms` method enabled, you need to have the `[auth.rdbms]` section in the configuration file, even if it is empty. The `methods` option is not required anymore and especially if you are using only one method, you can remove it.
* The `auth.scram_iterations` option was moved to [`auth.password.scram_iterations`](../configuration/auth.md#authpasswordscram_iterations).

See the [auth configuration](../configuration/auth.md) for details.

### Section `s2s`

* All options can be set globally or inside `host_config`.
* The `host_config.s2s` section overrides the whole global section now. Previously only the specified options were overridden.
* The `domain_certfile` option has been moved to the `general` section because it affects `c2s` connections as well.

### Section `host_config`

The rules for overriding global options in the `host_config` section have been simplified. The `auth` section and the `s2s.address` and `s2s.host_policy` options now completely override the corresponding general settings instead of being merged with them.

### Extension modules

* `mod_auth_token` has a new configuration format - if you are using this module, amend the [`validity_period`](../modules/mod_auth_token.md#modulesmod_auth_tokenvalidity_period) option.
* `mod_event_pusher` has an updated configuration format - the `backend` subsection is removed and the `http` backend has a new `handlers` option. Adjust your configuration according to [`mod_event_pusher`](../modules/mod_event_pusher.md) documentation.
* `mod_mam_meta` does not have the `rdbms_message_format` and `simple` options anymore. Use [`db_jid_format`](../modules/mod_mam.md#modulesmod_mam_metadb_jid_format) and [`db_message_format`](../modules/mod_mam.md#modulesmod_mam_metadb_message_format) instead.
* `mod_shared_roster_ldap` all options have their `ldap_` prefix dropped.
* `mod_vcard` LDAP options are moved into an LDAP subsection.

## Async workers

The `async_writer` flag of MAM is now a section on its own, that absorbs previous flags related to it: `flush_interval`, `max_batch_size` and `pool_size` now become subelements of the `async_writer` section, with one more parameter, `enabled`. Below an example:

```toml
[modules.mod_mam_meta]
  flush_interval = 1000
  max_batch_size = 100
  muc.async_writer = false
```
now becomes
```toml
[modules.mod_mam_meta]
  async_writer.flush_interval = 1000
  async_writer.batch_size = 100
  muc.async_writer.enabled = false
```

## Smart markers
There's an experimental and undocumented module called `mod_smart_markers`, that had a default table in the RDBMS schema, which you probably never used (or shouldn't have, as it was undocumented). If you rely on this table, the column `from_jid` has been split in `from_luser` and `lserver`, in order to support the `remove_domain` callback for the dynamic domains functionality. You might need to migrate it, or simply drop the previously defined table and recreate the new one.
