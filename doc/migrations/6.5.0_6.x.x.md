## MS SQL and ODBC are no longer supported

The Microsoft SQL Server database is no longer supported, and you cannot set the [RDBMS driver](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md/#outgoing_poolsrdbmsconnectiondriver) to `odbc` anymore.
In case you used this database, you need to migrate to another supported RDBMS, e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or CockroachDB.

## `mod_bosh` replaced with `mongoose_bosh_handler` and `service_bosh`

The `mod_bosh` module had inconsistent behaviour when configured for multiple host types (or static hosts).
This is why we have replaced it with [`service_bosh`](../configuration/Services.md#service_bosh).
You need to change your configuration to use the new service instead of the removed module.
If you had it configured in `host_config`, you can use the new option [`service_bosh.host_types`](../configuration/Services.md#servicesservice_boshhost_types) to achieve the same effect.

We have also moved the HTTP handler from `mod_bosh` to a new module called `mongoose_bosh_handler`.
In order to accept BOSH connections, you will need to update the handler name in your configured [HTTP listeners](../listeners/listen-http.md#handler-types-bosh-mongoose_bosh_handler) sections.

!!! Tip
    This is also a good opportunity to check if you really need the support for BOSH - if not, you can remove the `mod_bosh` module and HTTP handler without adding the new ones.

## Configuration options

### Removal of `rdbms_server_type`

The `general.rdbms_server_type` option is removed, and it has to be deleted from the TOML configuration file.
It was used to customize queries for the ODBC driver, which is not supported anymore.

### RabbitMQ connection pool

The RabbitMQ-specific connection option `max_worker_queue_len` is now replaced with a more generic [worker pool option](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md#outgoing_poolsmax_worker_queue_len) with the same name.
Contrary to the removed option, it now ensures that the queue limit is never exceeded.
Make sure you use the new option instead of the removed one.
