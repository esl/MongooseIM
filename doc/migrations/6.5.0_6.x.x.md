## MS SQL and ODBC are no longer supported

The Microsoft SQL Server database is no longer supported, and you cannot set the [RDBMS driver](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md/#outgoing_poolsrdbmsconnectiondriver) to `odbc` anymore.
In case you used this database, you need to migrate to another supported RDBMS, e.g. MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL or CockroachDB.

## Configuration options

### Removal of `rdbms_server_type`

The `general.rdbms_server_type` option is removed, and it has to be deleted from the TOML configuration file.
It was used to customize queries for the ODBC driver, which is not supported anymore.

### RabbitMQ connection pool

The RabbitMQ-specific connection option `max_worker_queue_len` is now replaced with a more generic [worker pool option](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md#outgoing_poolsmax_worker_queue_len) with the same name.
Contrary to the removed option, it now ensures that the queue limit is never exceeded.
Make sure you use the new option instead of the removed one.
