## Configuration options

### RabbitMQ connection pool

The RabbitMQ-specific connection option `max_worker_queue_len` is now replaced with a more generic [worker pool option](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md#outgoing_poolsmax_worker_queue_len) with the same name.
Contrary to the removed option, it now ensures that the queue limit is never exceeded.
Make sure you use the new option instead of the removed one.
