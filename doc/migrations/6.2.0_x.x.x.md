## Database migration

There is a new column in the `mam_message` table in the database, which is used to support including or excluding groupchat results in a user archive. See the migrations for Postgres, MySQL and MSSQL in the [`priv/migrations`](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/tree/master/priv/migrations) directory. Please be aware that the filtering process will only be effective for new messages and will not apply to those messages that have already been stored in the database.

## Presences

`mod_presences` was internally refactored to modernise and improve the performance of the code, but as a side-effect, code for [XEP-0018](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0018.html) was removed. Note that this XEP was not advertised and as a matter of fact was deprecated already in 2003, so if your client was depending on it, it is high time to update.

## Roster

`mod_roster` was internally refactored to modernise and improve the performance of the code, but as a side-effect, some database migrations need to be carried. See the migrations for Postgres, MySQL and MSSQL in the [`priv/migrations`](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/tree/master/priv/migrations) directory.

## Outgoing pools

Pools now take `host_type` and `single_host_type` instead of `host` and `single_host` in their scope, see [outgoing pools](../configuration/outgoing-connections.md) for more information.

Furthermore, pools are now configured as a list, where the pool tag is no longer a key in the TOML path but a KV-pair in the pool table. This way, for example, more than one pool with tag `default` can be configured for different scopes, for example a `global` `default` pool and a `single_host_type` `default` pool too.

```toml
[outgoing_pools.type.some_tag]
```
now becomes
```toml
[[outgoing_pools.type]]
  tag = "tag"
```

Please update your config file accordingly.
