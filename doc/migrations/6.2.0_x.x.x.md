## Database migration

There is a new column in the `mam_message` table in the database, which is used to support including or excluding groupchat results in a user archive. See the migrations for Postgres, MySQL and MSSQL in the [`priv/migrations`](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/tree/master/priv/migrations) directory. Please be aware that the filtering process will only be effective for new messages and will not apply to those messages that have already been stored in the database.

## Presences

`mod_presences` was internally refactored to modernise and improve the performance of the code, but as a side-effect, code for [XEP-0018](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0018.html) was removed. Note that this XEP was not advertised and as a matter of fact was deprecated already in 2003, so if your client was depending on it, it is high time to update.

## Roster

`mod_roster` was internally refactored to modernise and improve the performance of the code, but as a side-effect, some database migrations need to be carried. See the migrations for Postgres, MySQL and MSSQL in the [`priv/migrations`](https://github.com/esl/MongooseIM/tree/master/priv/migrations) directory.
