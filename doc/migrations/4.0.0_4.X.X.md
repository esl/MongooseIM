### `mod_http_notification` module is no longer available

`mod_http_notification` has been deprecated since MongooseIM 2.1.1 and it is no longer available in this release.
Please use the `http` backend for `mod_event_pusher`, which is the direct equivalent of `mod_http_notification`.

#### Metrics

`mod_http_notification` metric was updated and now is available as [`mod_event_pusher_http`](../../modules/mod_event_pusher_http/#metrics).

For more details on how to configure `mod_event_pusher` with `http` backend, please see [this section](../../modules/mod_event_pusher_http/).
