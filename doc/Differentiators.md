## Initial differences from the parent project

This project began its life as a fork of ejabberd v.2.1.8 back in 2011, and later underwent major cleanups, refactorizations and optimizations.

Major steps performed at that time:

*   Bringing the project source tree to compliance with OTP project structure recommendations
*   Swapping `autotools` for the Erlang community-standard build tool `rebar`
*   Removal of obsolete and/or rarely used modules to reduce maintenance burden
*   Reduction of runtime memory consumption by refactoring the code
    to use Erlang's binary data type for string manipulation and storage
    instead of operating on linked lists of characters
*   Functional test coverage of the system according to corresponding
    RFCs and XEPs
