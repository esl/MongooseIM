  title: "MongooseIM's REST API for backend administration"
  description: |
    Explore MongooseIM features using our REST API.

    If you are familiar with the `mongooseimctl` command, the provided control functionality will seem very similar.
    The response objects are modeled on the `ejabberd_commands` entries and print-outs from `mongooseimctl`.

    Please note that many of the fields such as **username** or **caller** expect a **JID** (jabber identifier, f.e. **alice@wonderland.com**). There are two types of **JIDs**:
      * **bare JID** - consists of **username** and **domain name** (XMPP host, usually the one set in your `mongooseim.toml` file).
      * **full JID** - is a **bare JID** with online user's resource to uniquely identify user's connection (f.e. **alice@wonderland.com/resource**).

    You should enable authentication to make sure the server can identify who sent the request and if it comes from an authorized user.
    Currently the only supported method is **Basic Auth**.
