### Module Description
This module implements an offline messages storage compliant with [XEP-0160: Best Practices for Handling Offline Messages](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0160.html). 
It stores one-to-one messages only when the recipient has no online resources. 
It is not well suited for applications supporting multiple user devices, because anything saved in the DB can be retrieved only once, so the message history is not synchronised between devices. 
Although `mod_offline` may be sufficient in some cases, it is preferable to use [mod_mam](mod_mam.md).

### Options
* `access_max_user_messages` (atom, default: `max_user_offline_messages`): Access Rule to use for limiting the storage size per user.
* `backend` (atom, default: `mnesia`): Storage backend. Currently `mnesia`, `odbc` and `riak` are supported. 

### Example Configuration
```
{mod_offline, [{access_max_user_messages, max_user_offline_messages}]},
```
