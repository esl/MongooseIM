### Module Description

This module implements [XEP-0357: Push Notifications](https://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0357.html).
It enables a service that notifies `PubSub` of a user's choice about every message that they could miss while being offline.
There are two control stanzas that the client may send to this module: `enable` and `disable`.
The `enable` stanza enables push notifications and forwards them to a specified `PubSub` node.
This stanza may also contain an optional `Data Form` that will be added to each and every notification to `PubSub` node as `publish-options`.
Please be sure to provide all form fields required by the specified `PubSub` node.
Any publish error may result in disabling push notifications to this node.

### Options

* **backend** (atom, default: `mnesia`) - Backend to use for storing the registrations.
 Currently only `mnesia` may be used.
* **wpool** (list, default: `[]`) - List of options that will be passed to the `worker_pool` library that handles all the requests.
 Please refer to the [Project Site](https://github.com/inaka/worker_pool) for more details.
* **plugin_module** (atom, default: `mod_push_plugin_default`) - Plugin module that implements a dynamic configuration. Currently this module allows configuring the parsing message `sender id` and can filter messages that shall not be published to the `PubSub` node.


### Example configuration

```Erlang
{mod_push, [
    {backend, mnesia},
    {wpool, [{workers, 200}]},
    {plugin_module, mod_push_plugin_default}
]}.
```
