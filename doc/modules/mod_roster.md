### Module Description
The module implements roster support, specified in [RFC 6121](http://xmpp.org/rfcs/rfc6121.html). 
Includes support for [XEP-0237: Roster Versioning](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0237.html). 
It can sometimes become quite a heavyweight feature, so there is an option to disable it.

### Options

* `iqdisc` (default: `one_queue`)
* `versioning` (boolean, default: `false`): Turn on/off support for Roster Versioning.
* `store_current_id` (boolean, default: `false`): Stores the last roster hash in DB (used in Roster Versioning). 
 Improves performance but should be disabled, when shared rosters are used.
* `backend` (atom, default: `mnesia`): Storage backend. 
 Currently `mnesia`, `odbc` and `riak` are supported.

### Example configuration
```
{mod_roster, [
               {versioning, true},
               {store_current_id, true}
             ]}
```
