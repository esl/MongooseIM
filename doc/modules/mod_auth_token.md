### Module Description

This module implements handling of tokens in oAuth-like authentication scheme. It provides necessary services to:

* deserialize/serialize binary tokens received and issued by server,
* validate incoming binary tokens, i.e.:
    * check integrity using Message Authentication Codes (MAC) with use of server-side stored user keys,
    * check validity against configured validity duration times,
    * check revocation status,
* handle token requests from logged in users.

The module itself does not implement protocol related details - these are implemented in `cyrsasl.erl`.
Generation of keys necessary to sign binary tokens is delegated to module `mod_keystore.erl`.

### Configuration

#### Validity periods

Access and refresh tokens validity periods can be defined independently.

Allowed units are:

* days
* hours
* minutes
* seconds

unless defined, the default values for tokens are:

* 1 hour for access token
* 25 days for refresh token

Example configuration from `ejabberd.cfg` - inside `modules` section:

```erlang
{modules, [
    {mod_auth_token, [{{validity_period, access}, {13, minutes}},
                      {{validity_period, refresh}, {13, days}}]
]}.
```

Validity period configuration for provision tokens is outside the module scope
since the server does not generate provision tokens - it only validates them.

#### Required keys

Keys are used for signing binary tokens using an HMAC with SHA-2 family function SHA-384.
Therefore, `mod_auth_token` requires `mod_keystore` to provide some predefined keys.

The required keys are (example from `ejabberd.cfg`):

```erlang
{mod_keystore, [{keys, [{token_secret, ram},
                        {provision_pre_shared, {file, "priv/provision_pre_shared.key"}}]}]}
```

`token_secret` is a RAM-only (i.e. generated on cluster startup, never written to disk)
key used for signing and verifying access and refresh tokens.

`provision_pre_shared` is a key read from file.
As its name suggests, it's a key shared with a service issuing provision tokens.
Clients then use these provision tokens to authenticate with MongooseIM.

While it's not enforced by the server and left completely to the operator,
`provision_pre_shared` keys probably should not be shared between virtual
XMPP domains hosted by the server.
That is, make sure module configuration specifying a `provision_pre_shared` key
is specific to an XMPP domain.

MongooseIM can't generate provision tokens on its own (neither can it distribute them to clients),
so while configuring a `provision_pre_shared` key to be RAM-only is technically possible,
it would in practice disable provision token support
(as no external service could generate a valid token with this particular RAM key).

### Token types

Three token types are supported:

- _access tokens_ - These are short lived tokens whose grants aren't
  tracked by the server (i.e. there's no need to store anything in a database).
  Access tokens can be used as a payload for the X-OAUTH authentication mechanism
  and grant access to the system.
  Access tokens can't be revoked.
  An access token is valid only until its expiry date is reached.

- _refresh tokens_ - These are longer lived tokens which are tracked by the server,
  therefore require persistent storage (as of now only PostgreSQL is supported).
  Refresh tokens can be used as a payload for the X-OAUTH authentication mechanism
  and grant access to the system, as well as result in a new set of tokens being
  returned upon successful authentication.
  Refresh tokens can be revoked.
  A refresh token is valid until it has expired, unless it has been revoked.
  On revocation, it immediately becomes invalid.
  As the server stores information about granted tokens, it can also
  persistently mark them as revoked.

- _provision tokens_ - These tokens are generated by a service external
  to the server and grant the owner a permission to create an account.
  A provision token may contain information which the server can use
  to provision the VCard for the newly created account.
  Using a provision token to create an account (and inject VCard data)
  is done similarly to other token types, i.e. by passing it as payload
  for the X-OAUTH mechanism.
  The XMPP server has no way of tracking / revoking provision tokens,
  as they come from an outside source.

### Token serialization format

All tokens (access / refresh / provision) are to be exchanged as *Base64 encoded* binary data.
Serialization format of the token before encoding with Base64 is dependent on its type:

```
'access' \0 <BARE_JID> \0 <EXPIRES_AT> \0 <MAC>

'refresh' \0 <BARE_JID> \0 <EXPIRES_AT> \0 <SEQUENCE_NO> \0 <MAC>

'provision' \0 <BARE_JID> \0 <EXPIRES_AT> \0 <VCARD> \0 <MAC>
```

For example (these tokens are randomly generated,
hence field values don't make much sense,
line breaks are inserted only for the sake of formatting,
`<vCard/>` inner HTML is snipped):

```
'access' \0 Q8@localhost \0 64875466454
    \0 0acd0a66d06934791d046060cf9f1ad3c2abb3274cc7e7d7b2bc7e2ac4453ed774b6c6813b40ebec2bbc3774d59d4087

'refresh' \0 qp@localhost \0 64875466457 \0 6
    \0 8f57cb019cd6dc6e7779be165b9558611baf71ee4a40d03e77b78b069f482f96c9d23b1ac1ef69f64c1a1db3d36a96ad

'provision' \0 Xmi4@localhost \0 64875466458 \0 <vCard>...</vCard>
    \0 86cd344c98b345390c1961e12cd4005659b4b0b3c7ec475bde9acc9d47eec27e8ddc67003696af582747fb52e578a715
```

### Requesting access / refresh tokens when logged in

```xml
<iq type='get' to='john@localhost' id='123'>
    <query xmlns='erlang-solutions.com:xmpp:token-auth:0'/>
</iq>
```

To request access and refresh tokens for the first time a client should
send an IQ stanza - after he has successfully authenticated
for the first time using some other method.

### Token response format

Requested tokens are being returned by server wrapped in IQ stanza with the following fields:

- `from` (bare user JID)
- `to` (full user JID)
- `id` (value taken from request IQ stanza)
- `type` (result)

Example response (encoded tokens have been truncated in this example):

```xml
<iq type='result' to='john@localhost/res1' id='123' from='john@localhost'>
    <items xmlns='erlang-solutions.com:xmpp:token-auth:0'>
        <access_token>cmVmcmVzaAGQ1Mzk1MmZlYzhkYjhlOTQzM2UxMw==</access_token>
        <refresh_token>cmVmcmVzaAGQ1Mzk1MmZlYzhkYjhlOTQzM2UxMw==</refresh_token>
    </items>
</iq>
```

Once a client has obtained a token (s)he may start authenticating
using the `X-OAUTH` SASL mechanism when reaching the authentication
phase of an XMPP connection initiation.

### Login with access/refresh token

In order to log into the XMPP server using a previously requested token
a client should send the following stanza:

```xml
<auth xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl" mechanism="X-OAUTH">
cmVmcmVzaAGQ1Mzk1MmZlYzhkYjhlOTQzM2UxMw== 
</auth>
```

The Base64 encoded content is a token obtained prior to authentication.
Authentication will succeed unless the used tokens are expired, revoked,
or the keys required for MAC verification could not be found by the server.

**When using a refresh token to authenticate with the server**,
the server will respond with a new *access token*:

```xml
<success xmlns="urn:ietf:params:xml:ns:xmpp-sasl">
cmVmcmVzaAGQ1Mzk1MmZlYzhkYjhlOTQzM2UxMw==
</success>
```

The above response is to be expected unless the refresh token used is expired
or there were some problems processing the key on the server side.

### Token revocation using command line tool

Refresh tokens issued by the server can be used to:

* log in a user - as an authentication valet,
* request *a new access token* with refreshed expiry date.

An administrator may *revoke* a refresh token:

```sh
mongooseimctl revoke_token owner@xmpphost
```

A client can no longer use a revoked token either for authentication
or requesting new access tokens.
After a client's token has been revoked in order to obtain a new refresh token
a client has to log in using some other method.

**Caveat:** as of now, the user's session is not terminated automatically on token revocation.
Therefore, the user might request a new set of tokens for as long as the session is active,
even though his/her previous token was just revoked (possibly due to a breach / token leak).
Moreover, an access token still kept on a compromised device can be used
to establish a new session for as long as it's valid - access tokens can't be revoked.
To alleviate rerequesting tokens by the user an operator can use
`mod_admin` extension allowing to terminate the user's connection.
Access token validity can't be sidestepped right now.
