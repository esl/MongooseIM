### Module Description
This module implements [XEP-0313 (Message Archive Management)](http://xmpp.org/extensions/attic/xep-0313.html). 
It enables a service to store all user messages for one-to-one chats as well as group chats (MUC, MultiUser Chat). 
It uses [XEP-0059: Result Set Management](http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0059.html) for paging. 
It is a highly customizable module, that requires some skill and knowledge to operate properly and efficiently.

Configure MAM with different storage backends:

* ODBC (RDBMS, like MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS SQL Server)
* Riak KV (NOSQL)
* Cassandra (NOSQL)


`mod_mam_meta` is a meta-module that ensures all relevant `mod_mam_*` modules are loaded and properly configured.

#### Full Text Search
This module allows message filtering by their text body (if enabled, see *Common backend options*). 
This means that an XMPP client, while requesting messages from the archive may not only specify standard form fields (`with`, `start`, `end`), but also `full-text-search` (of type `text-single`). 
If this happens, the client will receive only messages that contain words specified in the request.

The exact behaviour, like whether word ordering matters, may depend on the storage backend in use. 
For now `odbc` backend has very limited support for this feature, while `cassandra` does not support it at all. 
`riak` backend on the other hand should provide you with the best results when it comes to text filtering.

### Options

* **backend** (atom, default: `odbc`) - Database backend to use. `odbc`, `riak` and `cassandra` are supported.
* **add_archived_element** (boolean, default: `false`) - Add `<archived/>` element from MAM v0.2.
* **is_archivable_message** (module, default: `mod_mam_utils`) - Name of a module implementing [`is_archivable_message/3` callback](#is_archivable_message) that determines if the message should be archived.
 **Warning**: if you are using MUC Light, make sure this option is set to the MUC Light domain.
* **archive_chat_markers** (boolean, default: `false`) - If set to true, XEP-0333 chat markers will be archived. See more details [here](#archiving-chat-markers)
* **pm** (list | `false`, default: `[]`) - Override options for archivization of one-to-one messages. If the value of this option is `false`, one-to-one message archive is disabled.
* **muc** (list | `false`, default: `false`) - Override options for archivization of group chat messages. If the value of this option is `false`, group chat message archive is disabled.

**backend**, **add_archived_element** and **is_archivable_message** will be applied to both `pm` and `muc` (if they are enabled), unless overriden explicitly (see example below).

#### PM-specific options

* **archive_groupchats** (boolean, default: `true`) - When enabled, MAM will store groupchat messages in recipients' individual archives. **USE WITH CAUTION!** May increase archive size significantly. Disabling this option for existing installation will neither remove such messages from MAM storage, nor will filter out them from search results.
MongooseIM will print a warning on startup if `pm` MAM is enabled without `archive_groupchats` being explicitly set to a specific value. In one of the future MongooseIM releases this option will default to `false` (as it's more common use case and less DB-consuming) and the warning message will be removed.

#### MUC-specific options

* **host** (string, default: `"conference.@HOST@"`) - MUC host that will be archived if MUC archiving is enabled. 

#### Example

The example below presents how to override common option for `muc` module specifically.

```erlang
{mod_mam_meta, [
  {backend, odbc},
  {async_writer, true}, %% this option enables async writer for ODBC backend
  {muc, [
    {async_writer, false} %% disable async writer for MUC archive only
  ]}
]}
```

#### ODBC backend options

These options will only have effect when the `odbc` backend is used:

* **cache_users** (boolean, default: `true`) - Enables Archive ID to integer mappings cache.
* **odbc_message_format** (atom, default: `internal`) - When set to `simple`, stores messages in XML and full JIDs. 
 When set to `internal`, stores messages and JIDs in internal format. 
 **Warning**: Archive MUST be empty to change this option.
* **async_writer** (boolean, default: `true`) - Enables asynchronous writer that is faster than synchronous but harder to debug.

#### Common backend options

* **user_prefs_store** (atom, default: `false`) - Leaving this option as `false` will prevent users from setting their archiving preferences. It will also increase performance. Other possible values are:
  * `odbc` (ODBC backend only) - User archiving preferences saved in ODBC. Slow and not recommended, but might be used to simplify things and keep everything in ODBC.
  * `cassandra` (Cassandra backend only) - User archiving preferences are saved in Cassandra.
  * `mnesia` (recommended) - User archiving preferences saved in Mnesia and accessed without transactions. Recommended in most deployments, could be overloaded with lots of users updating their preferences at once. There's a small risk of an inconsistent (in a rather harmless way) state of the preferences table.
  * `mnesia_dirty` - like `mnesia`, but dirty synchronous writes are enabled.
* **full_text_search** (boolean, default: `true`) - Enables full text search in message archive (see *Full Text Search* paragraph). Please note that the full text search is currently only implemented for `odbc` and `riak` backends. Also, full text search works only for messages archived while this option is enabled.

#### <a id="is_archivable_message"></a>`is_archivable_message/3` callback

`is_archivable_message` option has to name a module exporting `is_archivable_message/3` function conforming to the spec:

```erlang
-spec is_archivable_message(Mod :: module(), Dir :: incoming | outgoing,
                          Packet :: jlib:xmlel()) -> boolean().
```

Servers SHOULD NOT archive messages that do not have a `<body/>` child tag. Servers SHOULD NOT archive delayed messages.

From MAM v0.3 onwards it is expected that all messages that hold meaningful content, rather than state changes such as Chat State Notifications, are archived.

#### Archiving chat markers

Archiving chat markers can be enabled by setting `archive_chat_markers` option to `true`. However it only works if
`is_archivable_message` callback module is set to `mod_mam_utils` or isn't set at all.

When performing full text search chat markers are treated as if they had empty message body.

### Riak backend

The Riak KV backend for MAM stores messages in weekly buckets so it's easier to remove old buckets.
Archive querying is done using Riak KV 2.0 [search mechanism](http://docs.basho.com/riak/2.1.1/dev/using/search/) called Yokozuna. 
Your instance of Riak KV must be configured with Yokozuna enabled.

This backend works with Riak KV 2.0 and above, but we recommend version 2.1.1.

### Cassandra backend

Edit main config section adding:

```erlang
{cassandra_servers, [{default, []}]}.
```

MongooseIM will create one pool with one worker to connect to localhost:9042.

You can change the default settings using extra parameters:
- 5 connections to each server with addresses from 10.0.0.1 to 10.0.0.4;
- Keyspace "mongooseim";
- Custom connect timeout in milliseconds;
- Custom credentials.

```erlang
{cassandra_servers,
 [
  {default,
   [
    {servers,
     [
      {"10.0.0.1", 9042, 5},
      {"10.0.0.2", 9042, 5},
      {"10.0.0.3", 9042, 5},
      {"10.0.0.4", 9042, 5}
     ]
    },
    {keyspace, "mongooseim"},
    {connect_timeout, 5000}, % five seconds
    {credentials, [{"username", "cassandra"}, {"password", "secret"}]}
   ]
  }
 ]
}.
```

### Example configuration

```erlang
{mod_mam_meta, [
        {backend, odbc},

        add_archived_element,

        {pm, [{user_prefs_store, odbc}]},
        {muc, [
               {host, "muc.example.com"},
               {odbc_message_format, simple},
               {async_writer, false}
               {user_prefs_store, mnesia}
              ]}
       ]}.
```
