### Module Description

This module handles the `push_notification` hook generated by `mod_pubsub` with an active `push` node.
Each `push_notification` hook is converted as a `REST` API call to the [MongoosePush](https://github.com/esl/MongoosePush) service. 
The following `publish-options` that are added to the hook are directly passed to `MongoosePush`:

 * `mode` - if not supplied, `prod` value will be used
 * `click_action` - optional. 
 See `click_action` in the FCM documentation or `category` in the APNS documentation.
 * `topic` - _null_ if not supplied
 * `service` - has to be specified and the value must be valid and supported by the MongoosePush push service provider. 
  E.g. `fcm`, `apns`.
 * `device_id` - has to be specified and the value must be valid device token received from push notification service provider specified in `service` option
 
In addition to those `publish-options` you may specify also `silent` option, that when set to 
`true` will result in "silent" notification. 
Silent notifications send only data payload to push notifications service provider with all 
fields specified in the notification without any modification and/or filtering.

#### Prerequisites

This module uses a connection pool created by mongoose_http_client. 
It must be defined in `http_connections` setting.

### Options

* **pool_name** (atom, required) - name of the pool to use (as defined in http_connections)
* **api_version** (string, default: `v2`) - REST API version to be used.
* **max_http_connections** (integer, default: 100) - the maximum amount of concurrent http connections

### Example configuration

```Erlang
{http_connections, [{mongoose_push_http,
    [{server, "https://localhost:8443"}]
}]}.

{mod_push_service_mongoosepush, [
        {pool_name, mongoose_push_http}
        {api_version, "v2"}
]}.
```
