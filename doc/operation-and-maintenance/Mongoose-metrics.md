# MongooseIM metrics

MongooseIM by default collects many metrics showing the user behaviour and general system statistics.
They are managed by [exometer](https://github.com/Feuerlabs/exometer).
MongooseIM uses [ESL's fork of this project](https://github.com/esl/exometer/tree/1.2.1-patched).

All metrics are divided into the following groups:

* Per host metrics: Gathered separately for every XMPP host supported by the cluster.
 **Warning:** If a cluster supports many (thousands or more) domains, performance issues might occur.
 To avoid this, use global equivalents of the metrics with `all_metrics_are_global` config option.
    * Hook metrics.
    They are created for every [hook](../developers-guide/Hooks-and-handlers.md) and incremented on every call to it.
* Global metrics: Metrics common for all XMPP hosts.
    * Data metrics.
    These are misc. metrics related to data transfers (e.g. sent and received stanza size statistics).
    * VM metrics. Basic Erlang VM statistics.
* Backend metrics: Histograms with timings of calls to various backends.

## Metrics types

### `spiral`

This kind of metric provides 2 values: `total` event count (e.g. stanzas processed) and a value in 60s window (`one` value).
Dividing `one` value by 60 provides an average per-second value over last minute.

**Example:** `[{total, 1000}, {one, 20}]`

### `value`

A simple value.
It is actually a one-element proplist: `[{value, N}]`.

**Example:** `[{value, 256}]`

### `gauge`

It is similiar to a `value` type but consists of two properties:

* `value`
* `ms_since_reset` - Time in milliseconds elapsed from the last metric update.

**Example:** `[{value, 12}, {ms_since_reset, 91761}]`

### `proplist`

A metric which is a nonstandard proplist.
You can find the lists of keys in metrics descriptions.

**Example:** `[{total,295941736}, {processes_used,263766824}, {atom_used,640435}, {binary,1513152}, {ets,3942592}, {system,32182072}]`

### `histogram`

A histogram collects values over a sliding window of 60s and exposes the following stats:

* `n` - A number of samples.
* `mean` - An arithmetic mean.
* `min`
* `max`
* `median`
* `50`, `75`, `90`, `95`, `99`, `999` - 50th, 75th, 90th, 95th, 99th and 99.9th percentile

## Per host metrics

### Hook metrics

There are more hook metrics than what is listed in this table, because they are automatically created for every new hook.
As a result it makes more sense to maintain a list of the most relevant or useful items, rather than keeping this table fully in sync with the code.

## Backend metrics

Some extension modules expose histograms with timings of calls made to their backends.
Please check the documentation of modules that are enabled in your config file, in order to learn if they provide them.

Besides these, following authentication metrics are always available:

* `[Host, backends, auth, authorize]`
* `[Host, backends, auth, check_password]`
* `[Host, backends, auth, try_register]`
* `[Host, backends, auth, does_user_exist]`

These are **total** times of respective operations.
One operation usually requires only a single call to an auth backend but sometimes with e.g. 3 backends configured, the operation may fail for first 2 backends.
In such case, these metrics will be updated with combined time of 2 failed and 1 successful request.

Additionaly, RDMBS layer in MongooseIM exposes one more metric, if RDBMS is configured:

* `[global, backends, mongoose_rdbms, query]` - Execution time of a "not prepared" query by a DB driver.
