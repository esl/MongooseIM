# Fields

- reason, class, stacktrace - standard error catching fields.
- module, function, line, timestamp, node, when, pid - reserved fields (could be used by logger itself).

When logging IQs, adding `acc` field should be enough. If `acc` not available, `iq` can be used.
If `iq` is not available, `sub_el` could be logged as last option.
