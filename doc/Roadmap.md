## Vision

The MongooseIM Platform provides solutions for high-scalability and high-performance messaging, social networking, and VoIP, for mobile/tablet and laptop/desktop computers. 
The products and services offered by the MongooseIM Platform allow businesses and administrations to build apps, with high and sustainable acquisition, retention, and referral, achieving massive network effect at planetary scale.

## Current state of the MongooseIM platform

The following components build up the MongooseIM platform, and not only the XMPP/REST server at its core.

## Roadmap

This is a previsional roadmap, so please note that the closer we get to an item, the more likely it is that something is going to change. 
The process we have decided on gives us the ability to react to change and demand in a lean and agile way, keeping the MongooseIM project truly opened to external inspiration and contribution.
This means that while we are pretty confident with the plan for the near future, nothing is set in stone. 

We are excited about the vision we have come up with, but want to improve it based on your ideas.
Please contact us and tell us about what features and improvements do you see as valuable in your project.
