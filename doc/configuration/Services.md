Some functionalities in MongooseIM are provided by "services".
A service is similar to a module, but while a module is started for every
host type and may have global or specific configuration, a service is started
only once with global configuration.
Currently, three modules are categorised as "service providers".
Eventually the modules which are not specific for a host type will be refactored to be services.

* **Syntax:** Each service is specified in its own `services.*` section.
* **Default:** None - each service needs to be enabled explicitly.
Typical services are already specified in the example configuration file.
* **Example:** A configuration of the `service_domain_db` service.

```toml
[services.service_domain_db]
  event_cleaning_interval = 1000
  event_max_age = 5000
```

## service_mongoose_system_metrics

MongooseIM system metrics are being gathered to analyse the trends and needs of our users, improve MongooseIM, and get to know where to focus our efforts.
See [System Metrics Privacy Policy](../operation-and-maintenance/System-Metrics-Privacy-Policy.md) for more details.

### `services.service_mongoose_system_metrics.report`
* **Syntax:** boolean
* **Default:** not specified
* **Example:** `report = true`

An explicit acknowledgement that the metrics are gathered and reported.
When this option is not specified, the reports are gathered, and a notification
appears in logs on startup.
Enabling this option silences the notification reminder that metrics are gathered.
When this option is set to `false`, System Metrics Service is not started and metrics are not collected.

### `services.service_mongoose_system_metrics.intial_report`
* **Syntax:** non-negative integer
* **Default:** `300_000` (milliseconds - 5 minutes).
* **Example:** `intial_report = 300_000`

Time delay counted when the service is started after which the first metrics report is created and sent.

### `services.service_mongoose_system_metrics.periodic_report`
* **Syntax:** non-negative integer
* **Default:** `108_000_000` (milliseconds - 3 hours)
* **Example:** `periodic_report = 108_000_000`

Time delay for a periodic update report to be created and sent.

### `services.service_mongoose_system_metrics.tracking_id.id`:
* **Syntax:** string
* **Default:** no default.
* **Example:** `tracking_id.id = "G-123456789"`

Tracking ID to forward the reported metrics so that they can be viewed in the Google Analytics dashboard.

### `services.service_mongoose_system_metrics.tracking_id.secret`:
* **Syntax:** string
* **Default:** no default.
* **Example:** `tracking_id.secret = "Secret"`

Removing the `services.service_mongoose_system_metrics` entry will result in the service not being started.
Metrics will not be collected and shared.
It will generate a notification that the feature is not being used.
The notification can be silenced by setting the `no_report` option explicitly.

## service_domain_db

This service is needed to use the dynamic domains API.
It is used to synchronise dynamic domains between nodes after starting.

### `services.service_domain_db.db_pool`

* **Syntax:** string
* **Default:** `global`
* **Example:** `db_pool = "my_host_type"`

By default, this service uses the RDBMS connection pool configured with the scope `"global"`.
You can put a specific host type there to use the `default` pool with the `host_type` scope for that particular host type. See the [outgoing connections docs](outgoing-connections.md) for more information about pool scopes.

### `services.service_domain_db.event_cleaning_interval`

* **Syntax:** positive integer
* **Default:** `1800` (seconds - 30 minutes)
* **Example:** `event_cleaning_interval = 1800`

The number of seconds between cleaning attempts of the `domain_events` table.

### `services.service_domain_db.event_max_age`

* **Syntax:** positive integer
* **Default:** `7200` (seconds - 2 hours)
* **Example:** `event_max_age = 7200`

The number of seconds after an event must be deleted from the `domain_events` table.

## Example configuration

```toml
[services.service_mongoose_system_metrics]
  report = true
  initial_report = 300_000
  periodic_report = 108_000_000
  tracking_id.id = "G-123456789"
  tracking_id.secret = "Secret"

[services.service_domain_db]
  db_pool = "global"
  event_cleaning_interval = 1800
  event_max_age = 7200
```
