## Define what port range the Erlang VM should
## listen on for Distributed Erlang connectivity,
## aka communication within an Erlang cluster.
## By default a random port in the ephemeral port range is used.
## If you want to open specific ports on your firewall,
## you have to explicitly set (uncomment) these ports here, too.
-kernel inet_dist_listen_min 30000
-kernel inet_dist_listen_max 30100

## Use TLS for connections between Erlang cluster members.
## Don't forget to override the paths to point to your certificate(s) and key(s)!
## Once a connection is established, Erlang doesn't differentiate between
## a client and a server - the same certs/keys can be used on both sides.
